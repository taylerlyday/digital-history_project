## Introduction

In life, we all have to make choices that come with repercussions and satisfaction. Not everyone will be in favor of these choices but as stated in our constitutional rights “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” When it comes to politics and the economy, freedom of speech is one of the biggest aspects. There are different approaches for fulfilling the ‘rights to freedom of speech’ like protesting, petitioning, parades, demonstrations, civil disobedience and so on. The most common tactic is protesting, where it is used to express thoughts or concerns about certain topics. The idea of protesting has been consistent throughout history from the beginning of its time. If we were to analyze the history behind protesting for political debates or political regulations. Protesting was and still is used as an instrument to convey a message of awareness for others. When it comes to the reactions of potesting there are three types: those who support it, those who don’t support it and those who don’t care too much for it. The concept of protesting has shifted over the years. It has gone from the basic idea of a union of people marching down the streets to people expressing concern through circulations like social media and mainstream media. The idea behind protesting hasn’t really changed but the form of protesting has expanded quite a bit. This is why it plays a substantial role in shaping politics. The decisions made by political officials shapes the economy and the public’s perspective. Speech, self conceptions and events are all a part of the determining factor for the effect of politics. The constituent relationship between politics and protesting is a reciprocity of each other. Most likely because politics can influence and spark up the need for protesting and vice versa where protesting can influence politics. Here is a chronological timeline after World War II that shows multiple occasions of the influence of protesting on politics.

# Suffrage Movement

The women’s suffrage movement was a decades-long fight to win the right to vote for women in the United States. It took activists and reformers nearly 100 years to win that right, and the campaign was not easy: Disagreements over strategy threatened to cripple the movement more than once. But on August 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was finally ratified, enfranchising all American women and declaring for the first time that they, like men, deserve all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. This movement led up to 'Black Friday" which happened in 1910. It was a demonstration including 300 women marched to the Houses of Parliament. They did this as an campaign for the voting of women’s rights. These events soon enough led to women's civil rights and equality to men.

# Gay Liberation Movement 

The Stonewall Inn opened its doors as a gay bar in 1967 in Greenwich Village, a neighborhood on the west side of Manhattan. The Inn’s initial clientele were mostly white gay men, but by 1969 it catered to people from all walks of life. Puerto Rican and African American gay men, drag queens, and queer youth, many of whom were kicked out of or ran away from their homes, found solidarity at Stonewall.
Places like the Stonewall Inn were safe havens from anti-LGBTQ+ policies enforced across America. Laws allowed LGBTQ+ people to be evicted from their homes, fired from jobs, imprisoned, and confined to mental institutions. New York also outlawed the sale of alcohol to gay people. Bars that disobeyed these laws were frequently raided by police who unjustly harassed, assaulted, and arrested queer customers. Such oppression led many queer people to mask their true identities in public and encouraged them to flock to private spaces like Stonewall.
