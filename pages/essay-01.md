{% include feature/line-chart.html data="sotu-20th-century" topic="foundations of America" %}

I chose to feature this graph because I feel like one of the concepts for the foundation of America is the english language itself. The language has added a lot more words to the dictionary compared to the 1900s. Since the standard American citizen has altered severly, I thought this graph would help with distinguishing the fact of how a lot has changed due to the American people overtime. [^1]

I am at a conference meet for track and field in Boseman, Idaho. I am going to just write about my experience here in paragraphs because I don't recall my essay topic right now. So, this is Day 1 of being here and it is very cold, as in -11 degrees cold.

## Introduction

Here's some sample text, written in Markdown.
In Markdown, any text with no empty lines between will become a paragraph.

Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! [^1]

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:

# Heading One

### My First Subheading
