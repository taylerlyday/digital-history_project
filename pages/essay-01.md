# The Art of English

## Introduction

I have decided to talk about how political events in the United States have changed the English language over the years. As we both know that when it comes to the English language, it can be very difficult to understand, even for those who have it as their first language. The language is so complex due to the distinguishing differences like the fact that we have multiple words for the same meaning which is very hard to comprehend especially when you compare it to the language of Spanish. In spanish there is one word for each definition and depending on the tense it may change but that’s all. Also, the rules that are established in grammar are often broken for some cases like words that sound the same but are spelled differently, or words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently. A fun fact is that every year, there are hundreds of new words being added into the dictionary. Since there are over tons of thousands of words in the dictionary, the foundations of English have changed as well. A lot of the words don’t stay as long as others due to its relevance for society at the time. Or most words go unnoticed so they are just taken out of the dictionary to create space for the possibility of more words to be added. Others achieve relevancy and become common words for the average person to say or use so they stay in the dictionary for those who may want to know or acknowledge its existence. 

Language is an important aspect of the political scene. The language is an instrument that describes events while being a part of the events. The meaning of language has been shifted over the years and plays a substantial role in shaping the political field as well. The political field includes the roles of the officials and the public’s perspective of events. Language, self conceptions and events are all a part of the determining factor for the effect of politics. The constituent relationship between politics and language can also be reversed. Most likely because language and politics are closely correlated and therefore difficult to analyze and understand without relating to the other. Language does shape politics, but politics shapes language as well. We won’t really get into that perspective but I will give you a chronological timeline from 1900-1945 that shows how the world has changed overtime. I believe that as the English changed overtime it has changed the political decisions as well and here are my reasons why.

I chose to feature this graph because I feel like one of the concepts for the foundation of America is the English language itself. The language has added a lot more words to the dictionary compared to the 1900s. Since the standard American citizen has altered severely, I thought this graph would help with distinguishing the fact of how a lot has changed due to the American people overtime.

# The Power of language

I will first talk about how the English language aims to create independence and a free mindset that deprives the mind of words that are necessary to form ideas and concepts rather than those who go based off of the way society looks at it. I have two examples, one being the Roosevelt Corollary in 1904 and the 17th Amendment that was established in 1913. I chose these examples because they help those to understand how the ever growing English language changed the surroundings around them for the greater good. They used the power of the English words to help stop aggression in one case and in another, it helped balance power within the country.

I chose to add this picture so it can give a further explanation of how powerful these words are in the political stance. 
### The Roosevelt Corollary

The Roosevelt Corollary was just an expansive depiction of the Monroe Doctrine. The Corollary was brought up by Theodoore Roosevelt in 1904. The Roosevelt Corollary was a message that insisted that the United States would intervene as a last solution to ensure that other nations in the Western Hemisphere fulfilled their obligations to international lenders. It also made sure that others did not violate the rights of the United States or bring aggression towards the American nations. According to the archive that I found, it states that “Roosevelt tied his policy to the Monroe Doctrine, and it was also consistent with his foreign policy of "walk softly, but carry a big stick." [^1] These words became iconic and were so powerful. The words in this phrase were used to state that the US will not interfere but if they have to, the opposing will suffer greatly.

### The 17th Amendment 

The 17th amendment stated “the first paragraph of Article I, section 3 of the Constitution and provides for the election of senators by replacing the phrase “chosen by the Legislature thereof” with “elected by the people thereof.” [^1] This reflected the idea that there was an unpopular opinion about the corruption and non efficiency that was known as the characteristics for the election of US senators in many states by legislation. The amendment was widely seen as a necessity to promote the idea that the influence of big business and other special interests on the selection of senators are bad and to prevent vacancies or frequent turnover in the Senate caused by party wrangling or changes of party leadership at the state level.

# Herbert Hoover's Influence

{% include feature/image.html filename="Hebert-Hoover.png" alt="Picture of Herbert Hoover" %}

I believe that there is a connection between the English language and political situations. For example the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. The Kellogg-Briand Pact is an agreement with multiple tactics that attempts to eliminate war as an instrument of national policy. It enforced protection laws over trades in the US. This was implemented in 1928 by Herbert Hoover. It was the greatest attempt as a series of peacekeeping efforts after the first World War with the Central Powers and the Allies. Also, I found an archive that talks about this along with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which was established in 1930. In the article it states that the tariff "was the most protective tariff in US history." [^2] The Tariff Act was used to raise import duties to protect American businesses and farmers, adding considerable strain to the international economic climate of the Great Depression. As the Great Depression struck the world and caused total chaos, Herbert believed that implementing this would help bring in revenue while protecting labor for the citizens. He used the concept of labor a lot while being in office and thrived off of it. The word 'labor' was in effect due to the lack of jobs and increase of debt that was being put on the country. In a newspaper article published by Waterbury which states that the "act helped to wreck Hoover" [^3] which lets me know that a lot of people were not in favor of this choice to implement the tariff.

# The Power of Words in the Newspaper 

I decided to add in a newspaper section which proves my point of the dangers of propaganda, the importance of being clear, and the risks and rewards of linguistic innovation. The dangers of propaganda were used in ways to convey a skewed depiction of reality or just misinterpreting information so the government or other agencies can be the first to publish the news. The reason why I chose this newspaper section to add to the essay is because the concepts of newspapers were at their greatest height. In the newspaper article it states "the most celebrated reforms, those enjoying the densest odor of sanctity--for example, the income tax, the direct primary, woman suffrage--were brought about by propaganda." [^4] This statement is what stood out to me because it's mentioning how these topics were being protested or promoted which caused propaganda. Then it goes on to say that propaganda will not die down due to the fact that a lot of people, organizations and companies use this tactic for themselves. Their power and influence swayed the audience even if it was accurate or not, and that still is done nowadays. For example with the previous newspaper article in the paragraph above [^5] it is against Hebert Hoover and his tariff plan, which may have swayed a lot more people to not be in favor of his idea as well. Another thing is that the newspapers were cheap and the people wanted to know what was going on locally or with the government. This was social media before commercials, television and the internet which are primary sources nowadays.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the English language has persuaded politics throughout the history of government. The language brings power, propaganda and peace to the world. It may not work in all situations. For example, When the process of determining whether the facts of a situation have been intentionally corrupted by people in power, there often is no corrective mechanism at hand, as there is in cases of the intentional corruption of language. I hope this essay helped you to see what I see when it comes to how language can influence politics.
